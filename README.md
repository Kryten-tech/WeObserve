# WeObserve
Linux server security manager for Kryten

Todo list:
- Output external IP rather than local
- Create menu that lets you choose which directory to monitor
- Create a program that reads and filters out IPs inside the logs and returns it to the person who requested
- Search for lines that are duplicates of each other and only keep one
- Add larger range of events (files deleted, files moved etc)
